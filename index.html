					WEB DEVELOPMENT
				</header>
				<p>
                    Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It is a broadterm involving various technologies, including web design, web content management,web scripting, web server, and web browser. We can also refer to the web developmentprocess as the development of a website.This document contains a list of the mostcommon web development technologies and tools.

                        <li>
                            <b>Internet : </b>The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computernetworks -- a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they havepermission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly tousers at other computers).
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>WWW : </b>The World Wide Web—commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web—is aninterconnected system of public web pages accessible through the Internet. The Web isnot the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of theInternet.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>URL : </b>Just as buildings and houses have a street address, web pages also have unique addressesto help people locate them. On the Internet, these addresses are called URLs (UniformResource Locators).
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Web Browser : </b>A web browser is application software for accessing the World Wide Web or a localwebsite. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browserretrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on theuser's device
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Web Server : </b>Every Website sits on a computer known as a Web server. This server is always connected to the internet. Every Web server that is connected to the Internet is given a unique address made up of a series of four numbers between 0 and 256 separated by periods. For example, 68.178.157.132 or 68.122.35.127.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>DNS : </b>DNS stands for Domain Name System. When someone types in your domain name, www.example.com, your browser will ask the Domain Name System to find the IP that hosts your site. When you register your domain name, your IP address should be put in a DNS along with your domain name. Without doing it your domain name will not be functioning properly.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Hosting : </b>Web hosting is a service of providing online space for storage of web pages. These web pages are made available via World Wide Web. The companies which offer website hosting are known as Web hosts.

                            The servers on which web site is hosted remain switched on 24 x7. These servers are run by web hosting companies. Each server has its own IP address. Since IP addresses are difficult to remember therefore, webmaster points their domain name to the IP address of the server their website is stored on.
                            
                            It is not possible to host your website on your local computer, to do so you would have to leave your computer on 24 hours a day. This is not practical and cheaper as well. This is where web hosting companies comes in.

					HTML
				</header>
				<p>
                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.               
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>HTML Tags : </b>HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags. When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>HTML Elements : </b>An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>HTML Attributes : </b> HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.
                    Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
                    Attributes should always be applied with start tag.
                    The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
                    The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only.
                    You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Features of HTML :-</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified.</li>
                        <li>It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags</li>
                        <li> It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows, Linux, and Macintosh, etc.</li>
                        <li>It facilitates the programmer to add Graphics, Videos, and Sound to the web pages which makes it more attractive and interactive.</li>
                        <li> It facilitates programmers to add a link on the web pages (by html anchor tag), so it enhances the interest of browsing of the user.</li>

                <p>
                    <b>Extensions : </b>VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Snippets : </b> Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements. In Visual Studio Code, snippets appear in IntelliSense (Ctrl+Space) mixed with other suggestions, as well as in a dedicated snippet picker (Insert Snippet in the Command Palette).

					CSS - CASCADING STYLE SHEETS
				</header>
				<p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
				</p>
                <p>
                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Selectors : </b>As elements are added to a web page, they may be styled using CSS. A selector designates exactly which element or elements within our HTML to target and apply styles (such as color, size, and position) to. Selectors may include a combination of different qualifiers to select unique elements, all depending on how specific we wish to be. For example, we may want to select every paragraph on a page, or we may want to select only one specific paragraph on a page.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Properties : </b>Once an element is selected, a property determines the styles that will be applied to that element. Property names fall after a selector, within the curly brackets, {}, and immediately preceding a colon, :. There are numerous properties we can use, such as background, color, font-size, height, and width, and new properties are often added.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Values : </b>We have selected an element with a selector and determined what style we’d like to apply with a property. Now we can determine the behavior of that property with a value. Values can be identified as the text between the colon, :, and semicolon, ;.
